# FTS3_example
FTS3 on SQL database to achieve more robust full-text search in SQL table than using SQL LIKE statement. I edited and simplified codes by mysamplecode.com and turned them into a ready-to-go project. He is amazing so be sure to check it out.


# Usage
Simply download ZIP or clone the project to your computer, then open in Android Studio.

# Notes
- I made a DataContract class to organize everything neat and tidy, so constants are easy to change in order to suit to your needs.

- If you encounter error in SearchView widget, you might need to change the SearchView import to Android support library version: android.support.v7.widget.SearchView. However, as long as you stay consistent in all implementations you should be fine.
